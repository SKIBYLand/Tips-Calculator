# Tips Calculator
## Python code
the algorithm calculate the amount(`meal_price`) in currencies of the tip (`custom_tip`) enter in percentage. <br>The result is given in a list of three elements:
  1.  Tip calculated for 15%;
  2.  Tip calculated for 20%;
  3.  The requested custom tip.

***The algorithm will be updated as it's my first project on Github.***
